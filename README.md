# coolchat
The purpose was to learn the power of websockets by building a distributed music playing app

I ended up downsizing to a simple chat app.

I tried to implement sockets at the lowest possible level (native javascript on client and server)
but ended up bogged down with bugs implementing simple things like session stores and cookie sending.

I caved in and used express with express-ws to speed things up.
